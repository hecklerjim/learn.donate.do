Learn, Donate, Do is designed to highlight as many of the attorcities in the world as possible. By displaying pertinent information and links in an easy to read and share 'card' format, we can quickly disseminate educational information and resources. Have you ever noticed how you hear non-stop about a certain issue for a week or two, and then suddenly it completely disapears from the media? We collectively seem to forget that, for example, Hong Kong (as of June 2020) is still protesting, or that China is still incarcerating Uighur Muslims at an astounding rate. This website serves to remeber all the injustices, not just the 'trending' or #popular ones. And beyond that, it shows how you can directly help by compiling links to organizations working tirelessly to solve these issues.

<strong>I need help with this site!</strong>
  
  I need contributors, ideas or moral support. This is a big undertaking and I simply don't have time. I think this project could really do a lot of good, but I can't make it happen by myself. Please contact me if you want to get involved or have some advice for me.

Note: most of the cards have not been coded. If you want to see an example of what they could look like see a completed card <a href="https://hecklerjim.github.io/learn.donate.do/coastal-gas-pipeline.html">here</a>
