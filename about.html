      <h1>About this Project</h1>
      <p>This project was inspired by <a href="https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/#" target="blank">this</a> carrd supporting the June 2020 protests for George Floyd. Learn, Donate, Do is meant to educate, inspire and support tangible action. Together we can fight injustice and make the world a better place for all. 
        <br>
        Browse <a href="index.html">our cards</a> to learn about some of the issues we currently face, and to find resources so that you can make your mark and fight for what you believe.
        <br>
        Because our cards offer quick concise links to valuable resources, <em>Learn, Donate, Do</em> is a great medium to disseminate vital information about pressing issues. It is lightweight and sharable.

  <Em>Learn, Donate, Do</Em> is meant to be used as a <em>jumping off point</em> to begin learning and educating yourself. We are not an intelectual authority on these issues, but rather want to compile a list of useful resources to educate and inspire action.

          <p>EverythingWrongintheWorld.com is designed to highlight as many of the attorcities in the world as possible. Have you ever noticed how you hear non-stop about a certain issue for a week or two, and then suddenly it completely disapears from the media? We collectively seem to forget that, for example, Hong Kong is <a href="/pages/umbrella-protests.html">still protesting</a>, or that China is still <a href="/pages/uighur-muslims">incarcerating Uighur Muslims</a> at an astounding rate. This website serves to remeber <em>all</em> the injustices, not just the 'trending' or #popular ones. And beyond that, it shows how you can directly help by compiling links to organizations working tirelessly to solve these issues.</p>

          The purpose of this website is not to act as an intellectual authority on these issues, but rather to compile a list of resources so readers can do their own research. We cannot possibly provide definitive answers to <em>all</em> the problems in the world (although we would like to), but we can provide links to people and organizations who are doing what we deem to be work in the right direction. If you are personally affected by an issue and feel we have misconstrued it, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> so we can rectify our mistake as soon as possible.

          The short answer is yes. Although <em>Learn, Donate, Do</em> strives for unbiased objectivity, this is an unnatainable goal. Our selection of which issues matter is a form of bias in itself. If you have any ideas on how we can reduce our biases, please don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.
